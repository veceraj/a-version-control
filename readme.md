# A Version control

## Examples in [examples.md (link)](examples.md).

## Running:

All the commands are run via main.py that handles the input.
I have setup a alis in zsh for main.py for better convenience.

I am curenlty on python version **3.11** (as of now latest version) and the code may not work on lower version mainly due to some typings.

``` bash
alias vc='python3 /path/to/main.py'
```

All commands in [examples.md](examples.md) are using this alias.
